🧠 Linked List Problem-Solving Strategy in Interviews
General Principles:
1.For coding assessments (e.g., online tests):
-Don’t worry too much about space complexity.
-Prioritize time efficiency above all.
2.For interviews (in person or remote):
-Time complexity is still the most important.
-But strive to use the most space-efficient solution possible.


🔧 Common Tools and Techniques for Linked List Problems:
1.Use of auxiliary containers:
-Such as hash tables, arrays, or ArrayLists to store nodes or values.
2.Fast and slow pointer technique (a.k.a. tortoise and hare):
-Useful for detecting cycles, finding midpoints, or partitioning the list.


🌀 Fast and Slow Pointer Use Cases:
1.Return the middle node:
Odd length list: return the exact middle node
Even length list: return the upper middle node

2.Return the middle node:
Odd length list: return the exact middle node
Even length list: return the lower middle node

3.Return the node before the middle:
Odd length list: return the node before the exact middle
Even length list: return the node before the upper middle

4.Return the node before the middle:
Odd length list: return the node before the exact middle
Even length list: return the node before the lower middle

🔍 Common Linked List Interview Question
Problem:
1.Given the head of a singly linked list, determine whether the list is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward)
1) Hash Table / Stack Approach (Recommended for coding assessments):
2) In-Place Reversal Approach (Preferred in interviews):


2.Linked List Partitioning Problem
Problem:
Given the head of a singly linked list and a pivot value x, rearrange the list so that:
All nodes with values less than x come before
All nodes equal to x stay in the middle
All nodes greater than x go to the end
The relative order within each group does not need to be preserved unless specified

Two Common Solutions:
1) Array-Based Partition (Recommended for written tests):
2) Three-Way Split (Recommended for interviews):


Deep Copy of a Special Linked List
You are given a special singly linked list node definition as follows:
class Node {
    int value;
    Node next;
    Node rand;
    Node(int val) { value = val; }
}
The rand pointer is a new addition to the traditional singly linked list. It can point to any node in the list, or to null.

✅ Task:
Given the head of a singly linked list of this structure (with no cycles),
implement a function to create a deep copy of the list and return the head of the copied list.

Time Complexity: O(N)
Extra Space Complexity: O(1) (excluding the space used for the new list itself)






给定两个可能有环也可能无环的单链表，头节点head1和head2。请实现一个函数，如果两个链表相交，请返回相交的 第一个节点。如果不相交，返回null
【要求】
如果两个链表长度之和为N，时间复杂度请达到O(N)，额外空间复杂度 请达到O(1)。



能不能不给单链表的头节点，只给想要删除的节点，就能做到在链表上把这个点删掉？
